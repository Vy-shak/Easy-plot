< Indroduction and story

Hello,
   before i decided to learn code i was an architect i holds degree in batchelor of architecure. during my college day's compiling the pdf into one and making sure that each pdf having correct order of sheet number was a big pain point for me. So with the help of the knowledge i decided to fix that problem for me and many archi students


< There are So much pdf mergers out there what does the easy-plot is fixing new?

   well.As i mentioned non of the pdf merger application in the market is serving the purpose of merging and writing the sheet number in the each pdf on the order. it help many students not to remember the previous and edit the the sheet number manully while ploting in autocad.
